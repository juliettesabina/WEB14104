## Client photography website
---
#### Introduction
I have decided that my client that I was going to create a protfolio website for was going to my friend Ania, she has been an asspiring photographer for a while and she has a real passion for it so this was the perfect opportunity to help her.

 

#### The Research  
Before I drew up any ideas that I could show her i had to look at other websites that where realted to get an idea of the comeptitors and picked 3 that I wanted to analise

######My clients target audience and her website imput.
I then had a meeting with my client and asked her about who her target audience was so that I was able to design her website based on who she is targeting. She said to me that she was targetting anyone who might not have enough money for a professional photographer for their occasion, she thought that a website that wasnt too professional but too amature-like would be the best as she isnt a professional and she didnt want to come across like that. She wanted a couple of images that she was proud of on her home page but didnt want a porfolio page. Doing this enabled me to draw out ideas that is based around what she wanted her site to look.

####Interface

After I analised the 3 websites and what was good and bad I drew up 2 ideas on how I think her page would look best

After i showed her the ideas on page I created 2 quick wireframes so that she was able to scroll down and get a feel of what I had in mind to make her website look the best.

####Back End Code
I then worked on my wordpress and any plugins I had to add, I had to add a contact-forum plugin and a social media link to my clients facebook that I created for her as she didnt have one.
