# Web Development  

## 007museum Website
---
#### Introduction
I have chosen to develope a website that is based on all things Bond, the 007 Museum website has everything you need to know about James Bond, it has content on it that inculdes collectable items, champagne, and other figures and objects. It also states all of the Films and the different people that played Bond previously.

#### Recipe 
The recipe was the first time I had properly used HTML/CSS, with the second point there is a difference between the first time i made it usuing the basic knowledge to when I decided to do research and make it look better. After doing this i felt more confident with HTML/CSS. 

#### Bad website
After looking at the bad website i picked which was the 007 museum, I didnt do any more research on inspiration nor did I create a moodboard on what I wanted to add or how I wanted my recreation site to look I went straight to my inital wireframes. From looking at the wesbite first time I already knew how I wanted it to look so I didnt feel the need to do a moodboard. 

#### Website Outcome 
* [007 museum](http://jjupp.raveweb.net/)

From all the challenges that I faced meantioned in the 'overal wesbite review' My wesbite didnt come out how i had imagined it but i think that how it is now is actually better than i had thought, the theme flows but I would like to carry this on and try and add more content, I would like the carry this on and see how much more I am able to do also it will help me learn new skills and more about wordpress and coding, to do this i will try and use wordpress in depth not just the face of wordpress from the theme
